Presenter: Your Name / Your Team

Slide 2: The Core Problem: Digital Amnesia
Title: The Universal Frustration of Chatbots
Visual: A simple two-panel comic.
Panel 1: User: "My project is 'Phoenix'." Chatbot: "Great!"
Panel 2 (next day): User: "What's my project name?" Chatbot: "I'm sorry, I don't have that information."
Key Talking Points:
Most AI interactions are stateless. They have no memory of past conversations.
This forces users to repeat themselves constantly.
It creates a transactional, impersonal experience, preventing the AI from becoming a true assistant.
Speaker Notes: "We've all been here. You spend time briefing an AI, only for it to forget everything a moment later. This is 'Digital Amnesia,' and it's the single biggest barrier preventing chatbots from becoming truly useful partners. Our project was built to solve this."
Slide 3: Our Vision: The Stateful Companion
Title: An AI That Remembers, Reasons, and Assists
Visual: A circular diagram with three interconnected concepts: Remember (Persistent Memory), Reason (LLM + ReAct Engine), Act (Autonomous Tools).
Core Mission Statement: To create a conversational agent with a persistent, semantic memory that can proactively assist users by autonomously using tools based on conversational context.
Speaker Notes: "Our vision was to move beyond the simple question-and-answer paradigm. We wanted to build a stateful companion. This required three key pillars: a memory that lasts, an intelligence that can reason about that memory, and the ability to take action in the real world."
Slide 4: Feature Deep Dive 1: The Dual-Memory System
Title: The Heart of the Agent: A Brain with Two Memories
Visual: A diagram showing a brain with two halves.
Left Half: "Working Memory" (Short-Term) -> ConversationBufferWindowMemory -> "What are we talking about right now?"
Right Half: "Knowledge Base" (Long-Term) -> FAISS Vector Store + SQLite -> "What important facts do I know from all time?"
Explanation:
Short-Term: Keeps track of the last 10 conversational turns for immediate context.
Long-Term: Stores key facts permanently. It's semantic, meaning it finds information based on meaning, not just keywords.
Speaker Notes: "The key to our agent's intelligence is its dual-memory system, much like a human's. It has a short-term working memory for the current conversation, and a powerful, semantic long-term memory to store facts, projects, and user preferences forever."
Slide 5: Feature Deep Dive 2: Autonomous Tool Use
Title: More Than a Chatbot: An Agent That Does Things
Visual: A flowchart of the ReAct (Reason-Act) loop: User Prompt -> Thought -> Action (Tool) -> Observation -> Final Answer.
Available Tools:
save_memory: Proactively saves important details to the long-term knowledge base.
find_memories: Searches the knowledge base to answer questions.
set_reminder: Creates time-based notifications with Windows desktop alerts and audio cues.
show_reminders: Displays your complete calendar of all reminders (past and future).
Speaker Notes: "This isn't just a language model. It's an agent. Using the ReAct framework, it can literally stop and 'think' about the best course of action. This might be answering you directly, or it might be deciding to use one of its tools, like saving a critical piece of information or setting a reminder that will actually notify you with desktop alerts and sounds."
Slide 6: Live Demo: A Day in the Life
Title: Let's See It in Action
Presenter Action: Run the agent live or show a screen recording.
Demo Script:
"The Briefing": Tell the agent about a new project, deadline, and stakeholder. Show how it autonomously calls save_memory.
"The Task": Ask it to "remind me to draft the project scope tomorrow morning." Show it calling set_reminder.
"The Notification": Demonstrate how the reminder triggers with both console display, Windows desktop toast notification, and audio alert beep.
"The Calendar Check": Ask "show me my reminders" or "check my calendar" to demonstrate the show_reminders tool displaying all past and future reminders with status indicators.
"The Follow-Up": Close and restart the agent to prove persistence. Then ask, "Who was the main contact for that project?" Show it using find_memories to retrieve the correct answer.
Speaker Notes: "I'm now going to walk you through a practical scenario. We'll start a project, set a task with enhanced notifications, and then come back later to see how the agent remembers every detail, proving its statefulness and utility. Notice how the reminder system provides multiple notification methods to ensure you never miss important tasks."
Slide 7: Architectural Blueprint
Title: How the Pieces Fit Together
Visual: The detailed Mermaid diagram from the README.
Key Walkthrough Points (Animate or highlight each step):
User input enters the AgentExecutor.
AgentExecutor packages the input with history and sends it to the LLM.
LLM returns a thought or an action.
If an action, AgentExecutor routes it to the correct Tool.
The Tool interacts with the EnhancedMemoryStore.
The Store updates the SQLite DB and FAISS Index.
A result is passed all the way back to the user.
Speaker Notes: "This diagram shows the flow of information. It's a highly modular system orchestrated by LangChain. The AgentExecutor is the brain, but the real power comes from how it seamlessly integrates the LLM, our custom memory store, and the specific tools we've given it."
Slide 8: Technical Stack
Title: The Technologies Powering the Agent
Visual: Use logos for each technology.
Core Frameworks:
LangChain: The primary orchestrator for building the agent logic.
Hugging Face: Provides the core intelligence via state-of-the-art models.
Data & Memory:
FAISS: For high-speed semantic similarity search.
SQLite: For robust, persistent storage of structured data.
Sentence Transformers: To convert text into meaningful vector embeddings.
Infrastructure:
Python 3.11+: The modern language foundation.
Rich: For a beautiful and user-friendly command-line interface.
Platform Features: Windows users get enhanced notifications with desktop toasts and audio alerts (gracefully degrades on other platforms).
Slide 9: Future Roadmap & Vision
Title: The Path Forward: From Assistant to Partner
Visual: A timeline or road with three milestones.
Phase 1: Expanding Senses (Next 3 Months)
Web Search Integration (Tavily): Give the agent access to real-time information.
File System I/O: Allow it to read, summarize, and write local documents.
Phase 2: Deeper Integration (Next 6 Months)
API Connectivity: Connect to external services like Google Calendar, Jira, or Slack.
GUI Frontend: Build a user-friendly web interface with Streamlit or Gradio.
Phase 3: Advanced Intelligence (Long-Term Vision)
Multi-Agent Systems: Enable collaboration between specialized agents.
Self-Improving Memory: Implement logic for the agent to autonomously review and summarize its own memories.
Slide 10: Conclusion & Key Takeaways
Title: Summary: Beyond the Chatbot
Takeaway 1: Statefulness is the Future: Persistent, semantic memory is the key to creating truly useful AI assistants.
Takeaway 2: Agents are More Than Models: The power lies in combining LLMs with tools and a robust architecture (like ReAct).
Takeaway 3: This is a Foundation: The agent is a powerful, extensible platform ready for integration with countless external APIs and future AI advancements.
